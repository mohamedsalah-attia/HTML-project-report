            <p>Some programmers are able to build a career out of being an
                expert in one language, but many programmers
                learn new languages frequently, Gorton says. Itâ€™s not uncommon for a professional programmer to be
                fluent in
                three or four different languages, he adds.

                The type of software you want to develop is one consideration for which programming languages to learn.
                While there are no concrete rules for what language is used to write what software, a few trends offer
                some
                guidance:

                Web-based startups are more likely to be programming in Python and JavaScript.
                Larger companies tend to develop their internal software applications using C# or Java and their Web
                applications using PHP.
                Programs for data analytics typically use the R and MATLAB programming languages.
                Embedded devices, such as those in the automotive and healthcare industries, run software written in C,
                C++,
                or Rust.
                Applications that run on the cloud are increasingly written in Go or Scala.
                Mobile applications are increasingly written in Swift or Kotlin.
