        <h1>1-Procedural Programming Language</h1>
        <fieldset style="font-size: 20px; border-radius: 20px;background-color: cornflowerblue;">
            <p>The procedural programming language is used to execute a sequence of statements which lead to a result.
                Typically, this type of programming language uses multiple variables, heavy loops and other elements,
                which
                separates them from functional programming languages. Functions of procedural language may control
                variables, other than function’s value returns. For example, printing out information.</p>
        </fieldset>
        <h1>2-Functional Programming Language</h1>
        <fieldset style="font-size: 20px; border-radius: 20px;background-color: cornflowerblue;">
            <p>Functional programming language typically uses stored data, frequently avoiding loops in favor of
                recursive
                functions.The functional programing’s primary focus is on the return values of functions, and side
                effects
                and different suggests that storing state are powerfully discouraged. For example, in an exceedingly
                pure
                useful language, if a function is termed, it’s expected that the function not modify or perform any o/p.
                It
                may, however, build algorithmic calls and alter the parameters of these calls. Functional languages are
                usually easier and build it easier to figure on abstract issues, however, they’ll even be “further from
                the
                machine” therein their programming model makes it difficult to know precisely, but the code is decoded
                into
                machine language (which are often problematic for system programming)</p>

        <h1>3-Object-oriented Programming Language</h1>
        <fieldset style="font-size: 20px; border-radius: 20px;background-color: cornflowerblue;">
            <p>This programming language views the world as a group of objects that have internal data and external
                accessing parts of that data. The aim this programming language is to think about the fault by
                separating it
                into a collection of objects that offer services which can be used to solve a specific problem. One of
                the
                main principle of object oriented programming language is encapsulation that everything an object will
                need
                must be inside of the object. This language also emphasizes reusability through inheritance and the
                capacity
                to spread current implementations without having to change a great deal of code by using polymorphism.

        <h1>4-Scripting Programming Language</h1>
        <fieldset style="font-size: 20px; border-radius: 20px;background-color: cornflowerblue;">
            <p>These programming languages are often procedural and may comprise object-oriented language elements, but
                they
                fall into their own category as they are normally not full-fledged programming languages with support
                for
                development of large systems. For example, they may not have compile-time type checking. Usually, these
                languages require tiny syntax to get started.</p>
        </fieldset>
        <h1>5-Logic Programming Language</h1>
        <fieldset style="font-size: 20px; border-radius: 20px;background-color: cornflowerblue;">
            <p>These types of languages let programmers make declarative statements and then allow the machine to reason
                about the consequences of those statements. In a sense, this language doesn’t tell the computer how to
                do

                something, but employing restrictions on what it must consider doing</p>
