            <h1 id="e">1-Python</h1>
            <p>
            <fieldset style="font-size: 20px; border-radius: 20px;background-color: cornflowerblue;">
                Benefits: Python is widely regarded as a programming language that’s easy to learn, due to its simple
                syntax,
                a large library of standards and toolkits, and integration with other popular programming languages such
                as
                C and C++. In fact, it’s the first language that students learn in the Align program, Gorton says. “You
                can
                cover a lot of computer science concepts quickly, and it’s relatively easy to build on.” It is a popular
                programming language, especially among startups, and therefore Python skills are in high demand.

                Drawbacks: Python is not suitable for mobile application development.

                Common uses: Python is used in a wide variety of applications, including artificial intelligence,
                financial
                services, and data science. Social media sites such as Instagram and Pinterest are also built on Python.

            <h1 id="e">2-JavaScript</h1>
            <fieldset style="font-size: 20px; border-radius: 20px;background-color: cornflowerblue;">
                <p>Benefits: JavaScript is the most popular programming language for building interactive websites;
                    “virtually
                    everyone is using it,” Gorton says. When combined with Node.js, programmers can use JavaScript to
                    produce
                    web content on the server before a page is sent to the browser, which can be used to build games and
                    communication applications that run directly in the browser. A wide variety of add-ons extend the
                    functionality of JavaScript as well.

                    Drawbacks: Internet browsers can disable JavaScript code from running, as JavaScript is used to code
                    pop-up
                    ads that in some cases can contain malicious content.

                    Common uses: JavaScript is used extensively in website and mobile application development. Node.js
                    allows
                    for the development of browser-based applications, which do not require users to download an
                    application.
                </p>

            <h1 id="e">3-Java</h1>
            <fieldset style="font-size: 20px; border-radius: 20px;background-color: cornflowerblue;">
                <p>Benefits: Java is the programming language most commonly associated with the development of
                    client-server
                    applications, which are used by large businesses around the world. Java is designed to be a loosely
                    coupled
                    programming language, meaning that an application written in Java can run on any platform that
                    supports
                    Java. As a result, Java is described as the “write once, run anywhere” programming language.

                    Drawbacks: Java is not ideal for applications that run on the cloud, as opposed to the server (which
                    is
                    common for business applications). In addition, the software company Oracle, which owns Java,
                    charges a
                    licensing fee to use the Java Development Kit.

                    Common uses: Along with business applications, Java is used extensively in the Android mobile
                    operating
                    system.</p>

            <h1 id="e">4-C#</h1>
            <fieldset style="font-size: 20px; border-radius: 20px;background-color: cornflowerblue;">
                <p>Benefits: Microsoft developed C# as a faster and more secure variant of C. It is fully integrated
                    with
                    Microsoft’s .NET software framework, which supports the development of applications for Windows,
                    browser
                    plug-ins, and mobile devices. C# offers shared codebases, a large code library, and a variety of
                    data
                    types.

                    Drawbacks: C# can have a steep learning curve, especially for resolving errors. It is less flexible
                    than
                    languages such as C++.

                    Common uses: C# is the go-to language for Microsoft ad Windows application development. It can also
                    be
                    used
                    for mobile devices and video game consoles using an extension of the .NET Framework called Mono

            <h1 id="e">5-C</h1>
            <fieldset style="font-size: 20px; border-radius: 20px;background-color: cornflowerblue;">
                <p>Benefits: Along with Python and Java, C forms a “good foundation” for learning how to program, Gorton
                    says.
                    As one of the first programming languages ever developed, C has served as the foundation for writing
                    more
                    modern languages such as Python, Ruby, and PHP. It is also an easy language to debug, test, and
                    maintain.

                    Drawbacks: Since it’s an older programming language, C is not suitable for more modern use cases
                    such as
                    websites or mobile applications. C also has a complex syntax as compared to more modern languages.

                    Common uses: Because it can run on any type of device, C is often used to program hardware, such as
                    embedded
                    devices in automobiles and medical devices used in healthcare.

            <h1 id="e">6-C++</h1>
            <fieldset style="font-size: 20px; border-radius: 20px;background-color: cornflowerblue;">
                <p>Benefits: C++ is an extension of C that works well for programming the systems that run applications,
                    as
                    opposed to the applications themselves. C++ also works well for multi-device and multi-platform
                    systems.
                    Over time, programmers have written a large set of libraries and compilers for C++. Being able to
                    use
                    these
                    utilities effectively is just as important to understanding a programming language as writing code,
                    Gorton
                    says.

                    Drawbacks: Like C, C++ has complex syntax and an abundance of features that can make it complicated
                    for
                    new
                    programmers. C++ also does not support run-time checking, which is a method of detecting errors or
                    defects
                    while software is running.

                    Common uses: C++ has many uses and is the language behind everything from computer games to
                    mathematical
                    simulations.

            <h1 id="e">7-PHP</h1>
            <fieldset style="font-size: 20px; border-radius: 20px;background-color: cornflowerblue;">
                <p>Benefits: PHP is widely used for server-side web development, when a website frequently requests
                    information
                    from a server. As an older language, PHP benefits from a large ecosystem of users who have produced
                    frameworks, libraries, and automation tools to make the programming language easier to use. PHP code
                    is
                    also
                    easy to debug.

                    Drawbacks: As Python and JavaScript have gained popularity, PHP’s popularity has dropped. PHP is
                    also
                    known
                    for its security vulnerabilities. According to Indeed, most PHP programmers take short-term roles
                    that
                    last
                    less than one year.

                    Common uses: PHP is the code running content-oriented websites such as Facebook, WordPress, and
                    Wikipedia.
